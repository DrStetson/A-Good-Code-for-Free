# A-Good-Code-for-Free
Coding Theory -> (16,M,5) Codes

This is my code and comments on how to generate 256 binary strings (codewords) each of length 16 and minimum Hamming distance 5.  The universe lined everything up on this one, hence the term free.  And it's a "good" code for now since we don't know the exact value of A_2(16,5).
